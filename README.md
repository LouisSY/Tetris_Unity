# Tetris_Unity
This is a Simple Tetris game made with Unity engine.

Hello!!! If you download this game, I hope you will have fun with it.



Press 'a' or '<-' to move the block to the left.

Press 'd' or '->' to move the block to the right.

Press 'w' or up arrow to rotate the block.

Press 's' or down arrow to accelerate the speed of falling.

Press 'r' to restart the game.

Press 'esc' to quit the game.


This is my first game made wth Unity. The game is not perfect. For example, if the blocks reach the top, the game will crash.

I probably will fix this bug in the future.

Hope you enjoy it!
